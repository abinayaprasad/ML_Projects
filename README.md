Here in this Repository i have uploaded the Machine Learning projects. Where I created ML Model by first cleaning the data 
Performed EDA process to find the Outliers and Nan Values so that we can remove/Convert the Nan values and reduce the Skewness in the data to provide Clean data
Performed Train_test_split method for training the Model 
Developed an ML Model by using appropriate Ml Algorithms.
